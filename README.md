# Automated Certificate Generator
Generally, to withdraw the certificate from the university we need to get clearance from various sections of the university. To get this clearance ,one has to go to each section separately and come up with recommendations. Which is very difficult and time consuming. This software is developed to solve this problem. Through this software, a student can send an application for certificate withdrawal to the register. The Registrar will accept this application form and send it to various sections through online mode. The officers of each section will provide recommendation by veryfying the information of the student. If the recommendations are received from all the sections, the automatic certificate will be generated by the signature of the register through the software. 

## Features

### Requirements gathering and analysis :

Requirement analysis is the first step in developing a prototyping model. During this phase,I collect the requirements from the administration section that are needed to build the application.

### Quick design :
According to the requirement , I simply create a design of the project in the time of discussion with the client .

### Build a Prototype :
During this stage, I intended actual prototype according to the knowledge gained from quick design. 

### Initial user evaluation :
At this stage, the proposed system is presented to the client for preliminary testing . It is beneficial to investigate the performance modelâ€™s strengths and weaknesses.
### Refining prototype :
When the client suggest me to add some feature, then I improve the current model and send it to the client to check . After client satisfaction  with the upgraded model I become prepared to finally build the project .
### Implement Product and Maintain :
After completely building and testing the project ,The final project was  distributed to client. To reduce downtime and prevent major failures, I  run the project on a regular basis.
